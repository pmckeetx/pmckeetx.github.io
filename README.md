# Peter McKee

👋 Hi, I’m **Peter McKee** — a developer advocate and engineering leader focused on code quality, DevOps, and building strong developer communities.

I’ve spent my career working at the intersection of **software engineering, developer experience, and education**, helping teams write better code, ship faster, and adopt modern tooling with confidence. I’ve led Developer Relations teams at companies like Sonar and Docker, spoken at conferences around the world, and written extensively about clean code, AI in software development, and DevOps practices.
